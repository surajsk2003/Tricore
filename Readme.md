## Overview
TriCore is a 2-player strategic triangle-placement game played on a 9√ó9 hexagonal board. Players take turns placing triangle-shaped pieces that point in different directions. The goal is to earn points by forming larger structures like hexagons, triangle clusters, and capturing central zones called fortresses.

## Game Rules

### Players
*   **Player 1:** Red Triangles üî∫
*   **Player 2:** Blue Triangles üîª (or Computer in AI mode)

### Triangle Orientations
Each triangle has one of six orientations:
*   üî∫ Pointing Up (default)
*   üîª Pointing Down
*   ‚óÄÔ∏è Pointing Left
*   ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Pointing Right
*   üîº Pointing Top-left
*   üîΩ Pointing Bottom-right

### Gameplay
1.  Select game mode: Human vs Human or Human vs Computer.
2.  Players take turns placing triangles on empty hexagonal cells.
3.  Choose the orientation of your triangle before placing it.
4.  Once placed, triangles cannot be moved (unless using the undo feature).
5.  After each placement, the game checks for scoring patterns.

### Scoring
*   **Hexagon Completion (6 points):** Form a perfect hexagon with 6 triangles of the same color.
*   **Macro Triangle (4 points):** Form a large triangle with 3 triangles of the same color pointing in the same direction.
*   **Fortress Capture (10 points):** Surround a central fortress zone with your triangles.

### Game End
The game ends when:
*   All cells are filled, OR
*   A player reaches 50 points, OR
*   A player resigns (this feature is not currently implemented).

The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the player who made more hexagons wins.

## Features
*   Two game modes: Human vs Human and Human vs Computer.
*   Interactive hexagonal game board.
*   Six different triangle orientations.
*   Visual indicators for completed scoring patterns.
*   Undo functionality to revert the last move.
*   Animated background.
*   Comprehensive rules section accessible in-game.
*   Responsive design (basic).

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (with animations)

*   Google Fonts (Poppins)

### Game Architecture
*   **Board Representation:** 9√ó9 grid of hexagonal cells.
*   **Player Tokens:** Triangular pieces with 6 possible orientations.

## Development

### Prerequisites
*   A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

### Local Setup
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/surajsk2003/Tricore.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
